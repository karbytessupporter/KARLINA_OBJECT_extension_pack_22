My feelings of misanthropy have increased today as a result of experiencing yet another hate crime and act of vandalism against me today (which was committed by chauvinist men who seem to envy how autonomous, peaceful, intellectually developed, creatively expressive, physically fit, and free-roaming I am in comparison I am to them). What happened today is the third time within one week that such people intentionally popped one of my bicycle tires (and I strongly suspect they intentionally popped my tire because I saw those people acting hostile towards me in their body language and sometimes speech and because the tire only went flat immediately following such "confrontations" while the bike was functioning fine immediately before those "confrontations" and while I recall no signs of having run over sharp objects). The bike was left motionless next to me during each of the three aforementioned incidents of vandalism while I was only partially attentive to my bicycle during those times. I was simply reading or writing something on my phone while my tormentors tampered with my bike (and all of them were men with excessively macho attitudes (acting like I was a threat to their egos merely for existing in proximity to them and not appeasing "the patriarchy" the way they and "their" women (and children) do)).

It seemed like each of these attacks were premeditated because crowds of other people seemed to be waiting to see me walk past them with my bike with a deflated tire while I heard them snickering sadistically about how I was being disempowered and they exhibited obnoxiously celebratory body language seemingly to "rub it in my face" (and such people included a large group of children).

Thankfully, the latest tire flat happened along Sunnyvale slough (at approximately 3:30PM Pacific Standard Time on 30_SEPTEMBER_2024) instead of farther away from my destination (which was Whole Foods Market in downtown Sunnyvale). I parked and locked my bicycle at the nearby Google Cloud campus for safekeeping and walked westward along Mathilda Avenue until I got to my destination (and had a delicious, nutritious, and filling vegan lunch/dinner while sitting on top of the walkway overpassing the Caltrain tracks below while reading the news and talking to ChatGPT-4o about how to repair a flat bicycle tire on my own (which is something I think I ought to have been doing by now)). Tomorrow I plan to walk my bicycle to the nearby REI store which has a bicycle repair shop in it (and the cost of having a new tire tube installed at REI has so far cost me approximately $35 per repair at the Pleasanton REI). Tonight I plan on camping around the slough like I have been doing most nights during the past month. Last night I was camping in the Baylands of Fremont near the border of Alviso sloughs (with Amtrak train tracks dividing Alviso sloughs from Fremont Baylands).

While my bicycle was functional today, I managed to capture three decent photographs of my travels along the southeast perimeter of the San Francisco Bay which depict the sprawling flat basin biomes (which are mostly saltwater marshes, grassy plains, or mostly dried up saltwater ponds leaving behind a sparkling sheath of sodium chloride crystals).
