Today karbytes made a critical update to the web page named CAUSALITY of the website named Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com. That update is highlighted cyan.

Today karbytes also contemplated a quasi-erotic bondage erotica story which karbytes put inside of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com (which can be found by using yesterday's calendar day date to look it up in that website's WordPress dot Com enabled search feature). That story is intended to be interpreted as fiction or perhaps as prose to deliberately confuse, amuse, or distress those who read it (because, based on some of the orange page content in Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com, it could be that the author of that story (who is also the author of Karlina Object dot WordPress dot Com) is suggesting that the story does actually depict non-fictional events somewhere throughout an all-encompassing multiverse).
