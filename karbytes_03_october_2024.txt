To be honest, I'm in agony on a nearly constant basis because, for some reason and by some technological means currently unknown to me, I am constantly being forced to listen to distracting and often antagonistic noises which seem to be emitted from devices implanted inside my skull and which seem designed to prevent me from being more introspective, mentally focused on what I want to focus my attention on, and seriously able to establish some kind of regular mindfulness meditation habit.
I think AJP may have helped install those devices (despite me lacking memories which are currently known to me about how that was accomplished) while spending time at his apartment with him present to monitor me the whole time (whether it was an overnight stay where I slept or a non-overnight stay). I think AJP is also involved in generating the harassing sound effects in an effort to hijack my cognitive resources and physiology in order to either serve his agenda and/or to punish me for qualities I exhibit or deeds I have committed which he does not approve of.

I also suspect my parents, other family members of mine, and some other people who know about my existence know about such harassment and even approve of it occurring and continuing to occur for an indefinitely long time because they think the harassment is working to make me more socially conformist, compliant, and humble instead of how I prefer to be.

I have depicted some of the most annoying and recurrent voices I hear via the aforementioned harassment in a web page which lists many video files featuring those sounds in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/pig_gorl/

Based on how I've observed other people behaving in public seemingly in response to my thoughts, emotions, and physical presence, it seems that other people have telepathic access to my thoughts and emotions or else those other people are also being spammed with the same sonic harassment I am. That does not explain how the "intracranial" sounds I hear seem to be in immediate response to the thoughts and psychosomatic qualia I focus my attention on. Perhaps I and every other human around me are living inside of a vast "soup" of interconnected and stealthily placed sensing, routing, and processing devices which effectively decimate concepts I had about what boundaries between individual humans are. 

Despite the relentless harassment I described that I've been going through (which I documented more details about in the web page at the following Uniform Resource Locator), I insist on only doing what I actually want to do instead of allowing other people's agendas to usurp me own: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_journal_2022_entry_138/

I do believe I am being tortured by other people against my will while people other than myself take sadistic pleasure in it and almost never show me sympathy nor offer me any useful insights about the matter. 

I also think the aforementioned torture is happening primarily to emasculate me and make me appear weaker and more disadvantaged than I would be without such harassment to people other than myself (and people who are envious of my otherwise good fortune and higher self-esteem). I do think more humans would rather me not achieve my goals than achieve them. I also think most people primarilyprimarily associate over common miseries and weaknesses instead of bonding over common personal development related endeavors.
