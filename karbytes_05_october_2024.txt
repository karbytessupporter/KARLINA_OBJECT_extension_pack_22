I had a fanciful idea that I could use the closet in my bedroom at my dad’s house as a place to grow my own psilocybin mushrooms (from one of those kits that can be ordered from the surface web and shipped to my residence address in Castro Valley, California for presumably less than $100) and also keep one of my laptops (or perhaps a Raspberry Pi device (which seems cheaper to purchase and more energy efficient to run than a laptop)) plugged into the wall and almost always turned on in order to host my own dark web page(s) and maybe even sell the shrooms I grow in my closet via the dark (or surface) web (and maybe even get a solar panel installed outside my bedroom window and powering that server so that I can truly say that I am making money come out of my closet with minimal effort and minimal investment from me). In all honesty, I am not really seriously intending to sell anything I grow or produce. I would instead just keep my shroom harvests for my own personal use and perhaps give some away as gifts to people other than myself. I just have a “fetish” for making valuable things come from a secretive basement-like setting which I am the sole proprietor of and inhabitant of.

The purpose of this note is to elaborate a little on the note I published both as a plain-text file and as a WordPress dot Com web page earlier today (i.e. 02_OCTOBER_2024) at approximately 2:30AM Pacific Standard Time and whose HTML version is available at the following URL: https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/

As soon as I turned on my (Ubuntu) laptop today, I noticed that my .onion web page (which I created yesterday and described in the aforementioned journal entry) was automatically being hosted by the Apache server which I installed on that laptop yesterday. I did not even open the command line nor even The Onion Router (Tor) before I was able to load that .onion web page on my Android phone (via the Tor app for Android). When I turned off my laptop and refreshed the Tor browser on my phone, I saw that the .onion web page was offline. Then I turned my laptop back on, established a (wireless) mobile Internet connection between my phone and the laptop, and saw that the .onion web page was back online again.

There are a few commands I thought I should record for future reference because they seem helpful in regards to keeping my dark web server running.

The following command line command checks the status of the Tor service communicating between client terminals visiting my .onion web page and the Apache server running on my Ubuntu laptop. (I keep getting the message “active (exited)”). To exit the status view mode, enter q.

sudo service tor status

The following command line command checks the status of the Apache service hosting my .onion web page whenever my laptop is on (unless I modify my laptop’s startup settings or disable or uninstall Apache). (I keep getting the message “active (running)”).

sudo service apache2 status

Finally, before I close this note, I would like to copy-paste a conversation I had with ChatGPT-4o earlier this morning at approximately 4:00AM Pacific Standard Time about what constitutes the informational content of the World Wide Web…

karbytes:

What is a larger percentage of the World Wide Web: the dark web, the surface web, or the deep web (and what is the percentage breakdown for each of those categories)?

ChatGPT:

The World Wide Web is divided into three major layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. Here’s a breakdown of these layers in terms of size and approximate percentage:

1. Surface Web: This is the portion of the web that is publicly accessible and indexed by search engines like Google. It includes websites such as news portals, blogs, and e-commerce sites. However, it makes up a relatively small part of the overall web.

– Estimated Percentage: About 4-5% of the entire web.

2. Deep Web: This is the portion of the web that is not indexed by search engines and is not directly accessible through traditional web browsers. It includes private databases, academic archives, cloud services, and password-protected content. Most of the deep web consists of legitimate content that simply isn’t accessible to the general public.

– Estimated Percentage: About 90-95% of the web.

3. Dark Web: This is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and accessible only through specific browsers like Tor. It includes anonymous websites and services, often associated with illicit activities, but also with legitimate privacy-seeking users.

– Estimated Percentage: About 0.01-0.1% of the web.

Summary:

– Surface Web: ~4-5%

– Deep Web: ~90-95%

– Dark Web: ~0.01-0.1%

The deep web is by far the largest part of the web, with the dark web being a very small fraction of it.

karbytes:

What is most of the data of the deep web?

ChatGPT:

Most of the data in the deep web consists of legitimate, private, or non-indexed information that is not accessible to the general public or search engines. Here are the primary sources of deep web content:

1. Databases: This includes large repositories of information that are not publicly searchable but are accessed through specific queries. Examples include:

– Academic Databases: Scientific journals, research papers, and dissertations (e.g., JSTOR, PubMed).

– Medical Records: Patient information and clinical databases in hospitals and research institutions.

– Legal Documents: Court records, legal filings, and governmental archives.

2. Private Websites: Password-protected or membership-based websites that restrict public access. Examples include:

– Corporate Intranets: Internal networks used by companies for operations, employee records, and communications.

– Subscription Services: Sites that require subscriptions or accounts (e.g., Netflix, news outlets behind paywalls).

– Cloud Storage: Files stored in services like Google Drive or Dropbox that are not indexed by search engines.

3. Financial Information: Banking transactions, payment records, and online financial systems that are secure and encrypted. Examples include:

– Online Banking: User transactions and statements.

– Payment Gateways: Services like PayPal or cryptocurrency wallets.

4. Government Data: This includes sensitive or restricted government information that isn’t accessible to the public. Examples include:

– Government Reports: Data from agencies that isn’t publicly available but used internally.

– Classified Information: Sensitive intelligence or military communications.

5. Email and Messaging Systems: Email providers, private messages, and communication platforms (e.g., Gmail, WhatsApp) are part of the deep web, as these communications are secure and not indexed.

6. Social Media Content: Many posts, profiles, and interactions on social media platforms are private or restricted to certain user groups, making them part of the deep web.

7. E-commerce and Online Marketplaces: Product listings, customer data, and transaction histories on sites like Amazon or eBay that are behind user logins or security measures.

8. Academic and Research Networks: University portals, research repositories, and data-sharing networks where access is restricted to students, researchers, or academics.

In summary, most of the deep web’s content is made up of databases, private communications, and restricted access information that is either password-protected, non-indexed, or designed for specific user groups rather than public consumption.
