Today I accidentally went home earlier than I needed to thinking that today was two weeks after taking my last shot of testosterone. When I arrived home (in Castro Valley after bicycling from Sunnyvale to Santa Clara to San Jose to Milpitas to Fremont (and then riding the BART trains from Warm Springs BART station to BayFair BART station to Castro Valley BART station)) at approximately 10:00PM Pacific Standard Time, I checked the plain-text file named karbytes_testosterone_updates.txt in the "micro directory" named KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22 of the "macro directory" (i.e. the web page named RAW_GITHUB_FILES_MACRO_DIRECTORY) of the website named Karbytes For Life Blog dot WordPress dot Com and discovered that it was only seven days since my last shot. 

Fortunately, going all this way was not a waste of my time because, if I did not have a reason to leave the Sunnyvale area I was staying at, I would not have ventured far enough eastward in time to record a beautiful video of a passenger train passing by me near the intersection of Gold Street and Gold Street Connector in San Jose when the after sunset dayglow and artificial lights were in optimal balance to create that glistening appearance which only occurs within a time window of approximately twenty minutes (before it gets too dark for my Android Galaxy A03 smartphone to take sufficiently high-resolution photographs of for those photographs to capture the details of the environment which my human vision can detect with greater clarity than that phone can).

Also, I get to take some time to use my laptop computer on the home Wi-Fi network at my legal residence in Castro Valley from the comfort of my own bedroom without any trouble tonight. (In the past, my devices had difficulty connecting to that Wi-Fi network and staying connected to that network). I figured I might as well take the time to compile what I think is the best photographs and/or videos I have recorded thus far of the bayland regions spanning the portion of the San Francisco Bay Area (of northern California) near the bay shoreline between Fremont, Milpitas, San Jose, Santa Clara, and Sunnyvale (but I excluding Mountain View because I do not like that area as much as the other aforementioned areas) and create a new web page in the aforementioned "micro directory" web page which showcases that compilation (and that will be relatively easy to do now that I have relatively unlimited access to the Internet without having to worry about running out of mobile AT&T data (which is metered (and costing approximately $20 per every 3 gigabytes I use) instead of data which I would only pay a flat monthly rate to use as much data as I want to during that payment cycle (akin to how I only pay OpenAI $20 per month to use ChatGPT-4o as much as I want to))).

Finally, I want to remind whoever my audience is that I have been spending most of my time living outside of my legal address while camping with my backpacking backpack in various places around the San Francisco Bay Area (i.e. the places I mentioned and Dublin/Pleasanton and occasionally other places within what I consider to be walking distance of BART or within "reasonable" driving distance of Castro Valley during the times I was still borrowing my parents' minivan to commute places (and I have since renounced driving a car in favor of bicycling and riding public transit because I enjoy that mode of transportation more and think it is better for the environment)). I figured that, eventually, I would spend more time taking advantage of the fact that I have a legal residence and private room at that residence which I have not yet been required to pay rent for. I will still probably spend most of my time camping for the foreseeable future than living at home because camping enables me to connect to the beautiful and inspiring nature reserves and to the bustling and interesting regional metropolises. Being "out in the world" gives me plenty of inspiration and opportunities to learn which I doubt are nearly as feasible to happen upon if I spent most or all of my time at home. I enjoy the variety of places I can go as a bike-packing camper and the fact that it enables me to be relatively secluded (which I relish for introspective and creative purposes) and to be relatively nomadic as though I were a foreigner visiting from some place outside of the Bay Area (which is convinient if I want to maintain relative anonymity and irregularity of appearance in places I visit semi-routinley or rarely (and having many of such known places to visit prevents me from "overstaying my welcome" in any one particular place)).

One last thing: tomorrow I am expecting a set of three blank M_DISCs I ordered from Amazon dot Com to arrive at the Ross store Amazon locker in my hometown's shopping center. I plan to spend the next twelve hours getting KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22 finalized before burning the contents of the mdisc_karbytes_ultra_2024_edition_15 burned to each of those three discs. For more information on that planned disc burning process, visit the following two web pages of KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_22:
