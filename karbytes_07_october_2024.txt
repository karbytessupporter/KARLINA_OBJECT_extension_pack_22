After spending approximately two hours at the Philz Coffee in downtown Sunnyvale (at approximately 12:30PM Pacific Standard Time) I walked across the courtyard to where I parked and locked my bike and found the front tire flattened (seemingly by vandals). This is the fourth time within one week that my bike tires have been flattened (seemingly by vandals each time). While I was walking to my bicycle, I heard some sulky and sordid man behind me chiding insults at me. I am convinced that there are territorial "ape men" patrolling this area acting like only their kind and those they approve of are welcome here. (I also had my wallet pick-pocketed here approximately two months ago while I was sitting down outside in the courtyard charging my electronics and covering myself with a camping blanket to block my view of annoying boys who kept bicycling in circles near me seemingly in an effort to annoy me). 

Fortunately, I'm not too far from the same REI I had the same tire flat repaired at is. I'll just walk it there and pay the same ~$35 to have the bike serviced and, sadly, probably never sit inside that Philz Coffee again (and never leave my bicycle unattended here for more than approximately ten minutes (especially in that chauvinist pig sty of a courtyard where many of the men are swaggering sulking brutes while "their" women are timid and suplicant sexed up "baby dolls")). I clearly don't fit the predominant culture of this region. Androgyny and indie types do not seem to welcome here because of those moralistic paternalistic patriarchy-enforcing thug monkeys (who are probably simpering little Christians who believe only they and the other "chosen ones" have a seat in Heaven).
