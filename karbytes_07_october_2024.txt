After spending approximately two hours at the Philz Coffee in downtown Sunnyvale (at approximately 12:30PM Pacific Standard Time) I walked across the courtyard to where I parked and locked my bike and found the front tire flattened (seemingly by vandals). This is the fourth time within one week that my bike tires have been flattened (seemingly by vandals each time). While I was walking to my bicycle, I heard some sulky and sordid man behind me chiding insults at me. I am convinced that there are territorial "ape men" patrolling this area acting like only their kind and those they approve of are welcome here. (I also had my wallet pick-pocketed here approximately two months ago while I was sitting down outside in the courtyard charging my electronics and covering myself with a camping blanket to block my view of annoying boys who kept bicycling in circles near me seemingly in an effort to annoy me). 

Fortunately, I'm not too far from the same REI I had the same tire flat repaired at is. I'll just walk it there and pay the same ~$35 to have the bike serviced and, sadly, probably never sit inside that Philz Coffee again (and never leave my bicycle unattended here for more than approximately ten minutes (especially in that chauvinist pig sty of a courtyard where many of the men are swaggering sulking brutes while "their" women are timid and suplicant sexed up "baby dolls")). I clearly don't fit the predominant culture of this region. Androgyny and indie types do not seem to be welcome here because of those moralistic paternalistic patriarchy-enforcing thug monkeys (who are probably simpering little Christians who believe only they and the other "chosen ones" have a seat in Heaven).

I'm back sitting at the same spot inside of the same Philz Coffee I was at yesterday. This time I decided to park (and lock) my bike immediately outside the cafe instead of further away and out of "line of sight" of where cafe dwellers are sitting. I parked my bicycle next to another bicycle which was parked and locked at the same bike rack (and I remember seeing that bicycle parked there yesterday). 

What I could do (if and when I get "sufficient funds" is buy sturdier (i.e. more puncture-resistant) bicycle tires), get a (replacement) portable bicycle tire pump, and tools and knowledge I would need to perform my own basic bicycle maintaince and repairs. There are many things I would be more willing to invest time, effort, and money in learning, doing, and acquiring provided I have more of what I deem to be financial stability (in the form of some kind of "sufficiently large", "sufficiently frequent", and "sufficiently ethical" income). 

Yesterday I published (and shared on my social media profiles (except for Facebook)) the following two blog posts (and the blog post named karbytes_08_october_2024) pertains to my personal financial situation and depicts the job I most recently held as a part-time (seasonal(?)) Amazon Flex warehouse employee and my quest to become financially independent (in a way which is "sufficiently compatible" with my personal goals and preferences):

The blog post named karbytes_05_october_2024 started off as a musing about how I could "make money" without having to leave my bedroom closet (and be the epitome of a hermitic nerd if I so choose to be and to my heart's content (but I understand that the chances of me being able to become truly financially independent doing that (i.e. not relying on anyone else but myself to bring in that dough) is probably not very likely (and I would prefer that everyone who wants to have shrooms be able to purchase them safely and reliably from local sources or to grow them at home themselves and only resort to the dark web marketplaces as a last resort or experimental option (because the dark web is notoriously populated with scammers)))). 

What I most liked about the blog post named karbytes_05_october_2024 is how it delves into what the World Wide Web is fundamentally constituted of (in the classifications named "surface web", "deep web", and "dark web") and, most of all, documenting my success at establishing a "real" (rather than merely localized to my own personal hotspot Internet connection) dark web connection between my Android phone (client) and my Linux laptop (server) such that the connection involved using Tor relays which were geographically stationed in random places other than my immediate location in space-time.

To wrap this note up (and hopefully to not "have to" open it up again with "bad news" about further vandalism, et cetera), I will say some words of advice to my past, future, and concurrent selves (and to any other person who might find the following advice personally useful):

True intelligence is a measure of how good you are at making decisions "in real time" (especially in adverserial and/or "fast paced" times) which ultimately lead to you getting more of what you really want in life and less of what you really don't want in life. Though it may be socially normal and even encouraged in some contexts to seek revenge on whoever "wrongs" you, it is ultimately a waste of your cognitive resources and time if you channel those resources towards doing someone wrong (in an effort to "enforce justice" on your own terms) instead of towards bettering your situation, your skill-set, and your well-being (and benefiting the world at large). Human nervous systems have some kludgy adaptations which make them more prone to focusing on what they percieve as threats and sources of "emotional negativity" than they are on innovating solutions to problems. The latter takes more intelligence than does the former, but choosing the "higher intelligence" path builds better problem-solving neural pathways in the human brain (especially if practiced consistently and suplimented with healthy psychedelics (especially psilocybin)). 

(When "thugs" physically beat me up, robbed me, verbally harassed me, and vandalized my belongings, I inevitably got into "fight or flight" mode as cortisol flooded my bloodstream, my heart rate increased, and I felt the need to take immediate action to defend myself. I did not experience the desire to "get revenge" until at least a few hours after most of those experiences (except for the ones where the vandalism happened while I was not looking or the incident was merely verbal harassment). When I felt the desire to "get revenge", I already learned to not react the way the antogonist seemed to want me to (and I could tell that the person taunting me was hoping I would fall to its intelligence level so that we would become embroiled in a recursive loop of retaliatory war-like behavior). I will just leave those people to figure themselves out and hope that they find a way to really solve the problems that are causing them to have to inflict harm on people other than themselves to feel better about their presumably shitty situation. I think that happy people are not as likely to want to increase the amount of suffering in the world (and I am excluding the category of suffering which is the discomfort (but not serious long-term damage) which inevitably occurs as a product of investing oneself in effortful and challenging situations)).

Last night (or early this morning at approximately 3:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 07_OCTOBER_2024) I was bicycling from where I was working on my latest software application (i.e. RSA_ENCRYPTION_TWO (which is a Python application)) to the location I've been camping at during the past two months without any difficulty. When I woke up at approximately 9:00AM Pacific Standard Time on 07_OCTOBER_2024, I noticed the back tire of my bicycle was flat. This is the fifth time a tire of my bicycle went flat (and I strongly suspect some human did it intentionally and I noticed that the flats tend to happen within twelve hours of uploading a photograph of my location to a public GitHub repository). I'm on my way to the Sunnyvale REI now to get the bicycle fixed.

This may or may not be related to the apparent bicycle vandalisms I've been through lately, but I decided to mention it anyway (despite me being initially reluctant to do so because I am trying to avoid giving into other people's implicit demands to give them publicity on my blog and to make them seem like important or powerful characters in my life when what I really think they are is desperate to feel socially valuable while automation and the proliferation of culturally liberal values threatens to relegate those people to relative obscurity, obsolescence, and impotence)...

Within two minutes of publishing a tutorial web page featuring a software application named RSA_ENCRYPTION (which is a C++ command line application), I got a weird text message from some phone number I didn't recognize whose area code was for Santa Clara County and whose content was solely a clipart picture of a handheld mirror with italicized font saying, "I hope your coffee tastes good and you feel pretty today." 

I immediately deleted it and did not reply to it because it seemed like spam designed to deliver some kind of passive-aggressive insult (and reinforce an untrue accusation that I'm vain, vapid, and desiring to be regarded as effeminate) and to be intrusively stalker-ish. Perhaps I did not respond to that person (who I assume is a cisgendered heterosexual man not as well-versed in computer programming and natural science as I am) with as much fervor as "he" wanted (and I didn't take the message seriously enough knowing that the veiled ad homimen attack it delivered was untrue yet I've heard several "blue collar" butt-hurt men chastise me in public for taking pride in my appearance and for preferring to be androgynous-masculine (instead of polarized to a traditional gender stereotype (especially feminine  (which seems to amount to little more than appeasement of and subservience to men and being relegated to the role of little more than child barer and caretaker of people))), solitary (instead of more extroverted and desperate to be included in some social group), and intellectual (instead of avoidant of intellectual depth).
