It is an aspiration of mine to not want people other than myself to suffer merely because I am suffering.

I think that most people, X, secretly (or not so secretly) prefer that people other than X suffer when X is suffering and such desire is the basis for most socializing (though I could be mistaken).

I generally assume the previous statement is true and use that as justification for why I do not seek to be included in some social group (but I do seek to do what I think is the bare minimum in terms of "schmoozing" to get access to the material commodities I need or desire). 

As an extension of what I said thus far in this note, I aspire to suffer alone rather than to look for other people to acknowledge my suffering, show me sympathy, or even suffer in similar ways to how I am suffering. 

The thoughts I expressed in this note thus far are logically supported by the (seemingly infallible) premise that a person's own subjective experience cannot be directly or literally shared with any other information processing agent (but such experiences can theoretically be (superficially) verbatim replicated if such experiences are recorded comprehensively enough in some (relatively) lossless data format and then transmitted over to a different information processing agent other than the information processing agent which is the original source of such transmissions. Pragmatically speaking, I assume less than five percent of a human's subjective experiences are that comprehensively transferred to the mind of some other information processing agent (whether that information processing agent is another human, some kind of similarly complex artificial intelligence, or some other entity with at least that much information processing capability). I also think it would be unethical to designate some human other than myself to be "on call" to regurgitate my own copied over subjective experiences (unless that person consents to such a task) because that would presumably rob that person of the opportunity to experience its own similarly complex subjective experiences apart from mine.

So now that I got that part of this note out of the way (which is the part justifying why I do not need to attend an emotional support group nor be attended to by counselors), I am ready to get to the next part of this note (which is the part where I essentially run my own criminal background check)...
