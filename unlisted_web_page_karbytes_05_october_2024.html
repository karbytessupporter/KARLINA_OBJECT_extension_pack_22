<p>I had a fanciful idea that I could use the closet in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9/main/room_of_karbytes_interior_28_september_2023.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my bedroom</a> at my dad&#8217;s house as a place to grow my own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psilocybin</a> mushrooms (from one of those kits that can be ordered from the surface web and shipped to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/map_of_karbytes_home_environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my residence address</a> in Castro Valley, California for presumably less than $100) and also keep one of my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptops</a> (or perhaps a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> device (which seems cheaper to purchase and more energy efficient to run than a laptop)) plugged into the wall and almost always turned on (and using either the house <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_router" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wi-Fi router</a> (which is notoriously very weak and unreliable (especially from that location) or else another Android phone with its own phone number and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIM card</a> which establishes a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile hotspot</a>) in order to host my own dark web page(s) and maybe even sell the shrooms I grow in my closet via the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark</a> (or <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surface</a>) web (and maybe even get a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solar panel</a> installed outside my bedroom window and powering that server so that I can truly say that I am making <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_25_june_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money</a> come out of my closet with minimal effort and minimal investment from me). In all honesty, I am not really seriously intending to sell anything I grow or produce. I would instead just keep my shroom harvests for my own personal use and perhaps give some away as gifts to people other than myself. I just have a &#8220;fetish&#8221; for making valuable things come from a secretive basement-like setting which I am the sole proprietor of and inhabitant of.</p>
<p>The purpose of this note is to elaborate a little on the note I published both as a plain-text file and as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress dot Com</a> web page earlier today (i.e. 02_OCTOBER_2024) at approximately 2:30AM Pacific Standard Time and whose <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a> version is available at the following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL</a>: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/</a></p>
<p>As soon as I turned on my (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a>) laptop today, I noticed that my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.onion</a> web page (which I created yesterday and described in the aforementioned <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a>) was automatically being hosted by the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache server</a> which I installed on that laptop yesterday. I did not even open the command line nor even The Onion Router (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tor</a>) before I was able to load that .onion web page on my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> phone (via the Tor app for Android). When I turned off my laptop and refreshed the Tor browser on my phone, I saw that the .onion web page was offline. Then I turned my laptop back on, established a (wireless) mobile <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet</a> connection between my phone and the laptop, and saw that the .onion web page was back online again.</p>
<p>There are a few commands I thought I should record for future reference because they seem helpful in regards to keeping my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark web</a> server running.</p>
<p>The following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command line</a> command checks the status of the Tor service communicating between client terminals visiting my .onion web page and the Apache server running on my Ubuntu laptop. (I keep getting the message &#8220;active (exited)&#8221;). To exit the status view mode, enter q.</p>
<pre>sudo service tor status</pre>
<p>The following command line command checks the status of the Apache service hosting my .onion web page whenever my laptop is on (unless I modify my laptop&#8217;s startup settings or disable or uninstall Apache). (I keep getting the message &#8220;active (running)&#8221;).</p>
<pre>sudo service apache2 status</pre>
<p>Finally, before I close this note, I would like to copy-paste a conversation I had with <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-4o</a> earlier this morning at approximately 4:00AM Pacific Standard Time about what constitutes the informational content of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>What is a larger percentage of the World Wide Web: the dark web, the surface web, or the deep web (and what is the percentage breakdown for each of those categories)?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is divided into three major layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. Here’s a breakdown of these layers in terms of size and approximate percentage:</p>
<p>1. Surface Web: This is the portion of the web that is publicly accessible and indexed by search engines like Google. It includes websites such as news portals, blogs, and e-commerce sites. However, it makes up a relatively small part of the overall web.</p>
<p>&#8211; Estimated Percentage: About 4-5% of the entire web.</p>
<p>2. Deep Web: This is the portion of the web that is not indexed by search engines and is not directly accessible through traditional web browsers. It includes private databases, academic archives, cloud services, and password-protected content. Most of the deep web consists of legitimate content that simply isn’t accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>&#8211; Estimated Percentage: About 90-95% of the web.</p>
<p>3. Dark Web: This is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and accessible only through specific browsers like Tor. It includes anonymous websites and services, often associated with illicit activities, but also with legitimate privacy-seeking users.</p>
<p>&#8211; Estimated Percentage: About 0.01-0.1% of the web.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>&#8211; Surface Web: ~4-5%</p>
<p>&#8211; Deep Web: ~90-95%</p>
<p>&#8211; Dark Web: ~0.01-0.1%</p>
<p>The deep web is by far the largest part of the web, with the dark web being a very small fraction of it.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>What is most of the data of the deep web?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Most of the data in the deep web consists of legitimate, private, or non-indexed information that is not accessible to the general public or search engines. Here are the primary sources of deep web content:</p>
<p>1. Databases: This includes large repositories of information that are not publicly searchable but are accessed through specific queries. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Academic Databases: Scientific journals, research papers, and dissertations (e.g., JSTOR, PubMed).</p>
<p>&#8211; Medical Records: Patient information and clinical databases in hospitals and research institutions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Legal Documents: Court records, legal filings, and governmental archives.</p>
<p>2. Private Websites: Password-protected or membership-based websites that restrict public access. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Corporate Intranets: Internal networks used by companies for operations, employee records, and communications.</p>
<p>&#8211; Subscription Services: Sites that require subscriptions or accounts (e.g., Netflix, news outlets behind paywalls).</p>
<p>&#8211; Cloud Storage: Files stored in services like Google Drive or Dropbox that are not indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>3. Financial Information: Banking transactions, payment records, and online financial systems that are secure and encrypted. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Online Banking: User transactions and statements.</p>
<p>&#8211; Payment Gateways: Services like PayPal or cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>4. Government Data: This includes sensitive or restricted government information that isn’t accessible to the public. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Government Reports: Data from agencies that isn’t publicly available but used internally.</p>
<p>&#8211; Classified Information: Sensitive intelligence or military communications.</p>
<p>5. Email and Messaging Systems: Email providers, private messages, and communication platforms (e.g., Gmail, WhatsApp) are part of the deep web, as these communications are secure and not indexed.</p>
<p>6. Social Media Content: Many posts, profiles, and interactions on social media platforms are private or restricted to certain user groups, making them part of the deep web.</p>
<p>7. E-commerce and Online Marketplaces: Product listings, customer data, and transaction histories on sites like Amazon or eBay that are behind user logins or security measures.</p>
<p>8. Academic and Research Networks: University portals, research repositories, and data-sharing networks where access is restricted to students, researchers, or academics.</p>
<p>In summary, most of the deep web&#8217;s content is made up of databases, private communications, and restricted access information that is either password-protected, non-indexed, or designed for specific user groups rather than public consumption.</p>

<p>What is most of the dark net data?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>[karbytes selected the following response which ChatGPT-4o generated two of (and the alternate response is pasted below the karbytes-selected response).]</p>
<p>[2/2]</p>
<p>Most of the data on the dark net (or dark web) consists of content that is deliberately hidden and accessible only through specific technologies like Tor (The Onion Router) or I2P (Invisible Internet Project). While the dark net is often associated with illicit activities, it also hosts legitimate uses for privacy and anonymity. The primary categories of dark net data include:</p>
<p>1. Illicit Markets and Services</p>
<p>&#8211; Black Markets: The dark web is infamous for hosting illegal marketplaces where users can buy and sell goods such as drugs, weapons, counterfeit documents, and stolen data. Popular examples include the now-defunct Silk Road.</p>
<p>&#8211; Fraudulent Services: Services related to identity theft, counterfeit currency, hacking tools, and fake IDs.</p>
<p>&#8211; Stolen Data: Markets for selling stolen credentials, credit card information, and personal data obtained through data breaches.</p>
<p>2. Cybercrime and Hacking Communities</p>

<p>[1/2]</p>
<p>The dark net (or dark web), a small portion of the deep web that requires specific tools like the Tor browser to access, contains various types of data. While often associated with illicit activities, it also hosts legal and privacy-conscious content. Here’s a breakdown of the types of data found on the dark net:</p>
<p>1. Illicit Marketplaces:</p>
<p>&#8211; Drugs: A significant portion of the dark net is dedicated to illegal drug trade, where users can anonymously buy and sell narcotics.</p>
<p>&#8211; Weapons: Some dark net markets sell firearms and other weapons, although these transactions are more niche.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hacking Services and Tools: Markets often provide hacking services, malware, stolen data, and tools to compromise systems.</p>
<p>&#8211; Counterfeit Goods: This includes fake documents (like passports and IDs), counterfeit currency, and other knock-off items.</p>
<p>2. Stolen Data and Information:</p>
<p>&#8211; Credit Card Information: Hacked or stolen credit card details are frequently bought and sold on the dark net.</p>
<p>&#8211; Personal Data: This includes data from data breaches such as social security numbers, login credentials, and other personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>&#8211; Corporate Data: Some dark net vendors deal in stolen corporate information, trade secrets, and other sensitive files obtained through cyberattacks.</p>
<p>3. Illegal Content:</p>
<p>&#8211; Child Exploitation: Unfortunately, the dark net hosts some of the worst forms of illegal content, including child exploitation material, which is vigorously pursued by law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8211; Violent Content: Certain dark web communities share violent or disturbing content, though access to these is heavily restricted and illegal.</p>
<p>4. Cryptocurrency and Financial Markets:</p>
<p>&#8211; Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Many dark net transactions use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to ensure anonymity. There are cryptocurrency mixers (services that obscure the transaction history of crypto funds) and services for laundering money.</p>
<p>&#8211; Scams and Fraudulent Services: Fraudulent investment schemes, pyramid scams, and &#8220;get-rich-quick&#8221; schemes also appear on the dark net.</p>
<p>5. Forums and Communities:</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous Forums: Discussion forums on the dark net allow users to exchange information on various topics. While some of these are for illicit activities, others are simply for privacy-focused users to discuss sensitive topics.</p>
<p>&#8211; Political Activism and Whistleblowing: Some parts of the dark net are used by activists, journalists, and whistleblowers to communicate and share information anonymously. Platforms like SecureDrop allow whistleblowers to submit sensitive data to journalists securely.</p>
<p>6. Anonymity Tools and Software:</p>
<p>&#8211; Encryption and Privacy Tools: Dark net sites offer privacy tools and resources for maintaining anonymity, such as VPN services, encryption software, and guides for secure communication.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hosting Services: Anonymous web hosting services, including those that specialize in hosting dark net sites, are also a part of the dark net ecosystem.</p>
<p>7. Legitimate Uses:</p>
<p>&#8211; Whistleblowing Platforms: Platforms like SecureDrop or WikiLeaks provide safe spaces for whistleblowers to share sensitive information.</p>
<p>&#8211; Censorship-Free Communication: In countries with strict censorship, some users turn to the dark net to communicate freely and access otherwise restricted information.<br />
&#8211; Privacy-Driven Blogging: Individuals and organizations host anonymous blogs or websites for privacy-conscious discussions on various subjects, from politics to personal safety.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>&#8211; Illicit goods and services (e.g., drugs, weapons, stolen data) dominate the dark net.</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymity tools and privacy-focused platforms also make up a portion of the dark net&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is also legitimate use, such as whistleblowing platforms and uncensored communication, but these make up a smaller portion compared to illicit activities.</p>
<p>The dark net is small relative to the entire web, and its reputation stems from both the illegal activities that occur there and the need for privacy and anonymity in legitimate activities.</p>
