<p>I had a fanciful idea that I could use the closet in <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/karlinarayberinger/KARLINA_OBJECT_extension_pack_9/main/room_of_karbytes_interior_28_september_2023.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my bedroom</a> at my dad&#8217;s house as a place to grow my own <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psilocybin" target="_blank" rel="noopener">psilocybin</a> mushrooms (from one of those kits that can be ordered from the surface web and shipped to <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/map_of_karbytes_home_environment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my residence address</a> in Castro Valley, California for presumably less than $100) and also keep one of my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laptop" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laptops</a> (or perhaps a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Raspberry Pi</a> device (which seems cheaper to purchase and more energy efficient to run than a laptop)) plugged into the wall and almost always turned on (and using either the house <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_router" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wi-Fi router</a> (which is notoriously very weak and unreliable (especially from that location) or else another Android phone with its own phone number and <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIM_card" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SIM card</a> which establishes a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tethering" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mobile hotspot</a>) in order to host my own dark web page(s) and maybe even sell the shrooms I grow in my closet via the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark</a> (or <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surface</a>) web (and maybe even get a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">solar panel</a> installed outside my bedroom window and powering that server so that I can truly say that I am making <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_25_june_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">money</a> come out of my closet with minimal effort and minimal investment from me). In all honesty, I am not really seriously intending to sell anything I grow or produce. I would instead just keep my shroom harvests for my own personal use and perhaps give some away as gifts to people other than myself. I just have a &#8220;fetish&#8221; for making valuable things come from a secretive basement-like setting which I am the sole proprietor of and inhabitant of.</p>
<p>The purpose of this note is to elaborate a little on the note I published both as a plain-text file and as a <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress dot Com</a> web page earlier today (i.e. 02_OCTOBER_2024) at approximately 2:30AM Pacific Standard Time and whose <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML</a> version is available at the following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">URL</a>: <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/</a></p>
<p>As soon as I turned on my (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubuntu</a>) laptop today, I noticed that my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.onion" target="_blank" rel="noopener">.onion</a> web page (which I created yesterday and described in the aforementioned <a style="background: #000000;color: #ff9000" href="https://karbytesforlifeblog.wordpress.com/karbytes_04_october_2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">journal entry</a>) was automatically being hosted by the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_HTTP_Server" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Apache server</a> which I installed on that laptop yesterday. I did not even open the command line nor even The Onion Router (<a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(network)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tor</a>) before I was able to load that .onion web page on my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a> phone (via the Tor app for Android). When I turned off my laptop and refreshed the Tor browser on my phone, I saw that the .onion web page was offline. Then I turned my laptop back on, established a (wireless) mobile <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet</a> connection between my phone and the laptop, and saw that the .onion web page was back online again.</p>
<p>There are a few commands I thought I should record for future reference because they seem helpful in regards to keeping my <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dark web</a> server running.</p>
<p>The following <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface" target="_blank" rel="noopener">command line</a> command checks the status of the Tor service communicating between client terminals visiting my .onion web page and the Apache server running on my Ubuntu laptop. (I keep getting the message &#8220;active (exited)&#8221;). To exit the status view mode, enter q.</p>
<pre>sudo service tor status</pre>
<p>The following command line command checks the status of the Apache service hosting my .onion web page whenever my laptop is on (unless I modify my laptop&#8217;s startup settings or disable or uninstall Apache). (I keep getting the message &#8220;active (running)&#8221;).</p>
<pre>sudo service apache2 status</pre>
<p>Finally, before I close this note, I would like to copy-paste a conversation I had with <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPT-4o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ChatGPT-4o</a> earlier this morning at approximately 4:00AM Pacific Standard Time about what constitutes the informational content of the <a style="background: #ff9000;color: #000000" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World Wide Web</a>&#8230;</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>What is a larger percentage of the World Wide Web: the dark web, the surface web, or the deep web (and what is the percentage breakdown for each of those categories)?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>The World Wide Web is divided into three major layers: the surface web, the deep web, and the dark web. Here’s a breakdown of these layers in terms of size and approximate percentage:</p>
<p>1. Surface Web: This is the portion of the web that is publicly accessible and indexed by search engines like Google. It includes websites such as news portals, blogs, and e-commerce sites. However, it makes up a relatively small part of the overall web.</p>
<p>&#8211; Estimated Percentage: About 4-5% of the entire web.</p>
<p>2. Deep Web: This is the portion of the web that is not indexed by search engines and is not directly accessible through traditional web browsers. It includes private databases, academic archives, cloud services, and password-protected content. Most of the deep web consists of legitimate content that simply isn’t accessible to the general public.</p>
<p>&#8211; Estimated Percentage: About 90-95% of the web.</p>
<p>3. Dark Web: This is a subset of the deep web that is intentionally hidden and accessible only through specific browsers like Tor. It includes anonymous websites and services, often associated with illicit activities, but also with legitimate privacy-seeking users.</p>
<p>&#8211; Estimated Percentage: About 0.01-0.1% of the web.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>&#8211; Surface Web: ~4-5%</p>
<p>&#8211; Deep Web: ~90-95%</p>
<p>&#8211; Dark Web: ~0.01-0.1%</p>
<p>The deep web is by far the largest part of the web, with the dark web being a very small fraction of it.</p>
<p>karbytes:</p>
<p>What is most of the data of the deep web?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Most of the data in the deep web consists of legitimate, private, or non-indexed information that is not accessible to the general public or search engines. Here are the primary sources of deep web content:</p>
<p>1. Databases: This includes large repositories of information that are not publicly searchable but are accessed through specific queries. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Academic Databases: Scientific journals, research papers, and dissertations (e.g., JSTOR, PubMed).</p>
<p>&#8211; Medical Records: Patient information and clinical databases in hospitals and research institutions.</p>
<p>&#8211; Legal Documents: Court records, legal filings, and governmental archives.</p>
<p>2. Private Websites: Password-protected or membership-based websites that restrict public access. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Corporate Intranets: Internal networks used by companies for operations, employee records, and communications.</p>
<p>&#8211; Subscription Services: Sites that require subscriptions or accounts (e.g., Netflix, news outlets behind paywalls).</p>
<p>&#8211; Cloud Storage: Files stored in services like Google Drive or Dropbox that are not indexed by search engines.</p>
<p>3. Financial Information: Banking transactions, payment records, and online financial systems that are secure and encrypted. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Online Banking: User transactions and statements.</p>
<p>&#8211; Payment Gateways: Services like PayPal or cryptocurrency wallets.</p>
<p>4. Government Data: This includes sensitive or restricted government information that isn’t accessible to the public. Examples include:</p>
<p>&#8211; Government Reports: Data from agencies that isn’t publicly available but used internally.</p>
<p>&#8211; Classified Information: Sensitive intelligence or military communications.</p>
<p>5. Email and Messaging Systems: Email providers, private messages, and communication platforms (e.g., Gmail, WhatsApp) are part of the deep web, as these communications are secure and not indexed.</p>
<p>6. Social Media Content: Many posts, profiles, and interactions on social media platforms are private or restricted to certain user groups, making them part of the deep web.</p>
<p>7. E-commerce and Online Marketplaces: Product listings, customer data, and transaction histories on sites like Amazon or eBay that are behind user logins or security measures.</p>
<p>8. Academic and Research Networks: University portals, research repositories, and data-sharing networks where access is restricted to students, researchers, or academics.</p>
<p>In summary, most of the deep web&#8217;s content is made up of databases, private communications, and restricted access information that is either password-protected, non-indexed, or designed for specific user groups rather than public consumption.</p>

<p>[1/2]</p>
<p>The dark net (or dark web), a small portion of the deep web that requires specific tools like the Tor browser to access, contains various types of data. While often associated with illicit activities, it also hosts legal and privacy-conscious content. Here’s a breakdown of the types of data found on the dark net:</p>
<p>1. Illicit Marketplaces:</p>
<p>&#8211; Drugs: A significant portion of the dark net is dedicated to illegal drug trade, where users can anonymously buy and sell narcotics.</p>
<p>&#8211; Weapons: Some dark net markets sell firearms and other weapons, although these transactions are more niche.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hacking Services and Tools: Markets often provide hacking services, malware, stolen data, and tools to compromise systems.</p>
<p>&#8211; Counterfeit Goods: This includes fake documents (like passports and IDs), counterfeit currency, and other knock-off items.</p>
<p>2. Stolen Data and Information:</p>
<p>&#8211; Credit Card Information: Hacked or stolen credit card details are frequently bought and sold on the dark net.</p>
<p>&#8211; Personal Data: This includes data from data breaches such as social security numbers, login credentials, and other personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>&#8211; Corporate Data: Some dark net vendors deal in stolen corporate information, trade secrets, and other sensitive files obtained through cyberattacks.</p>
<p>3. Illegal Content:</p>
<p>&#8211; Child Exploitation: Unfortunately, the dark net hosts some of the worst forms of illegal content, including child exploitation material, which is vigorously pursued by law enforcement.</p>
<p>&#8211; Violent Content: Certain dark web communities share violent or disturbing content, though access to these is heavily restricted and illegal.</p>
<p>4. Cryptocurrency and Financial Markets:</p>
<p>&#8211; Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Exchanges: Many dark net transactions use cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin to ensure anonymity. There are cryptocurrency mixers (services that obscure the transaction history of crypto funds) and services for laundering money.</p>
<p>&#8211; Scams and Fraudulent Services: Fraudulent investment schemes, pyramid scams, and &#8220;get-rich-quick&#8221; schemes also appear on the dark net.</p>
<p>5. Forums and Communities:</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymous Forums: Discussion forums on the dark net allow users to exchange information on various topics. While some of these are for illicit activities, others are simply for privacy-focused users to discuss sensitive topics.</p>
<p>&#8211; Political Activism and Whistleblowing: Some parts of the dark net are used by activists, journalists, and whistleblowers to communicate and share information anonymously. Platforms like SecureDrop allow whistleblowers to submit sensitive data to journalists securely.</p>
<p>6. Anonymity Tools and Software:</p>
<p>&#8211; Encryption and Privacy Tools: Dark net sites offer privacy tools and resources for maintaining anonymity, such as VPN services, encryption software, and guides for secure communication.</p>
<p>&#8211; Hosting Services: Anonymous web hosting services, including those that specialize in hosting dark net sites, are also a part of the dark net ecosystem.</p>
<p>7. Legitimate Uses:</p>
<p>&#8211; Whistleblowing Platforms: Platforms like SecureDrop or WikiLeaks provide safe spaces for whistleblowers to share sensitive information.</p>
<p>&#8211; Censorship-Free Communication: In countries with strict censorship, some users turn to the dark net to communicate freely and access otherwise restricted information.<br />
&#8211; Privacy-Driven Blogging: Individuals and organizations host anonymous blogs or websites for privacy-conscious discussions on various subjects, from politics to personal safety.</p>
<p>Summary:</p>
<p>&#8211; Illicit goods and services (e.g., drugs, weapons, stolen data) dominate the dark net.</p>
<p>&#8211; Anonymity tools and privacy-focused platforms also make up a portion of the dark net&#8217;s content.</p>
<p>&#8211; There is also legitimate use, such as whistleblowing platforms and uncensored communication, but these make up a smaller portion compared to illicit activities.</p>
<p>The dark net is small relative to the entire web, and its reputation stems from both the illegal activities that occur there and the need for privacy and anonymity in legitimate activities.</p>

<p>When I interact with a JavaScript based single web page application via Tor (and that application is part of a .onion page), where is the JavaScript function execution taking place? </p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>When you interact with a JavaScript-based single-page application hosted on a .onion website via Tor, the JavaScript function execution takes place locally in your browser.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a more detailed breakdown of the process:</p>
<p>1. JavaScript Execution: When you load a .onion page, the server sends the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and any other resources needed for the web page. The JavaScript code that defines the functionality of the web application is executed by your browser. In this case, since you are using Tor Browser, it will handle and execute the JavaScript.</p>
<p>2. Tor Network: The Tor network simply anonymizes your connection to the .onion server by routing your traffic through multiple relays to hide your IP address and encrypt your data. Tor does not affect the way JavaScript is executed. Once the resources are delivered to your browser, the JavaScript code runs just like it would in any other browser environment.</p>
<p>3. Local Execution: All JavaScript execution happens locally on your machine, within your browser, regardless of whether the site is a .onion or a regular clearnet site. The .onion domain just changes the method of communication between your browser and the server.</p>
<p>Therefore, when you interact with a JavaScript-based application on a .onion page through Tor, the actual execution of the functions happens on your local browser, but all the interactions between your browser and the web server (e.g., fetching data or sending inputs) are anonymized via the Tor network.</p>

<p>How many computers are involved in that relaying process (and is there a way to find out how many and where they are located)?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>When you connect to a website via the Tor network, your traffic is routed through three Tor relays (or nodes) by default: the entry (or guard) node, the middle (or relay) node, and the exit node. Here’s an overview of how these work:</p>
<p>1. Entry Node (Guard Node): This is the first relay that your computer connects to. It knows your real IP address, but it doesn’t know your destination (the website you&#8217;re visiting).</p>
<p>2. Middle Node (Relay Node): This is an intermediary node that only knows the IP addresses of the previous node (the entry node) and the next node (the exit node). It doesn’t know your IP address or the final destination.</p>
<p>3. Exit Node: This is the last node in the chain. It sends your traffic to the final destination (the .onion site in your case). For regular websites, it would normally know the destination site you&#8217;re visiting but not your IP address. For .onion sites, no exit node is needed because the communication stays entirely within the Tor network, keeping your traffic fully encrypted.</p>
<p>How Many Computers Are Involved?</p>
<p>In the typical Tor connection, there are three computers involved in the relaying process (entry, middle, and exit nodes). However, for .onion sites, no exit node is needed because the traffic never leaves the Tor network, so only the entry and middle nodes are involved.</p>
<p>Can You Find Out Where the Relays Are Located?</p>
<p>The Tor network is designed to provide anonymity for both the user and the relays themselves, so you cannot easily determine the exact number or location of the specific relays used in your connection. However, you can find out some information:</p>
<p>1. Relay Count: While you can&#8217;t know the exact number of computers your connection is relayed through (because that’s managed by the Tor protocol), it&#8217;s typically three nodes as mentioned.</p>
<p>2. General Information on Relays: The Tor network itself publishes a list of public relays and their geographical locations (by IP address). You can use services like Tor Metrics to view information about publicly known relays.</p>
<p>3. Tor Browser Tools: In the Tor Browser, you can see which relays you&#8217;re using during a particular session. Click the onion icon next to the address bar, and it will show the IP addresses of the relays involved in your connection, but it will not give their exact geographic locations or detailed information about them.</p>
<p>4. Geographical Location: If you know the IP addresses of the relays, you could use external tools (like WHOIS lookup or IP geolocation services) to get an approximate idea of where these relays are located. However, this location information may not always be accurate, as relays can be distributed across various parts of the world.</p>
<p>In summary, while the Tor Browser can show you which relays are being used for your connection, it does not provide detailed information about their exact number, real-world locations, or operators due to the design of the Tor network for privacy and security reasons.</p>

<p>How many Tor relay nodes does my connection to a .onion web page use if the client computer is the same machine as the server which hosts that .onion web page?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>If the client computer (the machine you&#8217;re using to browse the web) is the same machine as the server hosting the .onion web page, the number of Tor relay nodes involved is effectively zero—your connection does not need to pass through any relays at all. Here’s why:</p>
<p>1. Local Connection: Since the client and server are the same machine, the traffic doesn&#8217;t need to leave your computer and re-enter via the Tor network. Tor handles this entirely locally without routing your traffic through the typical entry, middle, or exit nodes.</p>
<p>2. Hidden Service (Onion Service): For .onion services, Tor typically routes the traffic within the Tor network. However, in this case, since the server is on the same machine as the client, there is no need to use any external relays. Your machine simply accesses its own local .onion service.</p>
<p>3. Direct Access: Because your machine is both the client and the server, it handles the request internally. The request for the .onion page is resolved locally without being sent through the Tor network, making the use of relay nodes unnecessary.</p>
<p>In this setup, your machine handles both sides of the communication, so there are no external relays involved in routing the traffic between client and server. However, Tor will still be used internally for the connection, ensuring that .onion protocols are followed, but it won’t utilize external nodes.</p>

<p>Is there a way to make my connection pass through external relays?</p>
<p>ChatGPT:</p>
<p>Yes, it is possible to make your connection pass through external Tor relays, even if the client and server are hosted on the same machine. To do this, you would need to configure the client to behave as if it&#8217;s connecting to a remote .onion service rather than directly accessing the local service.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways to achieve this:</p>
<p>1. Separate Client and Server Instances</p>
<p>You can simulate a regular Tor connection with relays by ensuring the client and server are separate, even though they are on the same machine:</p>
<p>&#8211; Use Virtualization or Containers: You can set up a virtual machine (VM) or use Docker containers to separate the client and server environments on the same physical machine. The client (inside a VM or container) would access the .onion site as if it were on an external server. This way, the traffic from the client instance would still be routed through the standard Tor relays before reaching the .onion service hosted in a separate VM/container.</p>
<p>&#8211; Separate Tor Services: Run two separate instances of the Tor service on your machine: one for hosting the .onion website (the server) and one for browsing (the client). This separation ensures that Tor routes traffic through the external network, including relays, to access your .onion service, even if it&#8217;s technically on the same machine.</p>
<p>2. Modify Tor&#8217;s Configuration</p>
<p>By default, if the client and server are on the same machine, Tor will optimize the connection by not routing traffic through the external network. However, you can configure the client to force the connection through external Tor relays:</p>
<p>&#8211; Use a Remote .onion Address: Assign a different hostname or IP address for the .onion service in your Tor configuration (even if the service is local), forcing Tor to treat the service as if it were remote.</p>
<p>&#8211; Disable Local Shortcut Optimization: You can modify the Tor configuration file (torrc) to force external relay use. There is no direct configuration flag to &#8220;force external relays,&#8221; but you could play with network isolation settings and ensure that the client does not recognize the server as local.</p>
<p>3. Set Up a Remote .onion Service</p>
<p>If you want to fully mimic the real-world conditions of accessing .onion services via external relays:</p>
<p>&#8211; Host the .onion Service Remotely: While this means setting up your .onion service on a separate machine or server, this guarantees that your connection will be routed through external relays. If the server is in a different physical location or network, your client connection will pass through the normal Tor relay structure (entry, middle, and exit nodes if necessary).</p>
<p>4. Tor Bridges</p>
<p>If you want to make sure your traffic passes through additional hops for anonymity, you can configure your Tor client to use Tor bridges. Bridges are unlisted relays that act as additional nodes between your client and the rest of the Tor network, potentially adding more layers of relays.</p>
<p>In summary, the simplest way to force your connection through external relays is to separate the client and server instances by using VMs, containers, or running multiple instances of Tor on the same machine. You can also modify the Tor configuration to disable local optimizations that bypass relays, though this may require some manual configuration adjustments.
